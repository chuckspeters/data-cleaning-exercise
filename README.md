# Data cleaning and visualization Project
#A dashboard showing Cars,Years, makes and prices and thier distribution across different states in America.
This dashboard was built from a dataset of various car makes and their prices and years.
Below are my data cleaning checklist:
- Understanding the Data
- handling blank cells
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting and formatting data types
- Checking for inconsistencies.
- Tabulizing the dataset

After cleaning my dataset, i Loaded it into powerbi. created a new measure to help calculate the total number of cars using the unique VIN numbers in the dataset. Then i showed KPIs and visualization. with the use of different visualization tools,I created a dashboard to show the following:

- Total number of cars
- number of cars by make
- Distribution of the Car makes in various State
- Average Price of Car makes.
- total number of each car make in the dataset
- Total number of cars by each state
- Total number of each car make and thier average prices.

Thank you.
